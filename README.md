 # 🎨 Multi-Color Detection using OpenCV

A real-time color detection tool built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **NumPy**. This project identifies multiple predefined colors from your webcam feed using the **HSV color space**, and highlights them with bounding boxes and labels.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure Python is installed. Then open a terminal and run:

 ⚙️ How It Works
 
📸 Captures video frame-by-frame from your webcam
🌈 Converts each frame from BGR to HSV color space
🧪 Applies a color mask based on predefined HSV ranges
🔍 Finds contours in each color mask
🟦 Draws bounding boxes around significant areas
🏷 Labels the detected region with the color name
